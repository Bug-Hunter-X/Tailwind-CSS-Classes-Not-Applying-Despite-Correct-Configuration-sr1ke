# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not applied to elements, even though the configuration seems correct and the generated CSS appears to be valid.  The issue is not related to typos or incorrect class names. The bug occurs in scenarios when Tailwind directives are used within conditional rendering. The solution presented below shows how to properly address this issue.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (`npm install`).
3. Run the development server (`npm run dev`).
4. Observe that the `div` with the `bg-red-500` and `p-4` classes does not have the expected styling applied.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind directives are correctly applied within conditional rendering. This example incorporates proper conditional rendering with Tailwind.
